Dimensionality reduction is simply, the process of reducing the dimension of your feature set. Your feature set could be a dataset with a hundred columns (i.e features) or it could be an array of points that make up a large sphere in the three-dimensional space. Dimensionality reduction is bringing the number of columns down to say, twenty or converting the sphere to a circle in the two-dimensional space.



This application attempts to visualize MDS, NMDS, PCA and PLS.
